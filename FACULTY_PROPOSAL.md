## Addressing Potential Concerns

### **"Will students just let AI do the work?"**
The chatbot is designed as a *guide*, not a *generator*. It:
- Asks questions rather than providing answers
- Requires students to articulate their own ideas
- Cannot complete assignments for them
- Encourages reflection and critical thinking
- Students must still do research, writing, and video creation themselves

### **"Is AI appropriate for young learners?"**
This implementation is specifically designed for ages 14+:
- Bounded to educational, conservation-focused content
- No collection of personal data
- Encourages learning *about* AI while learning *with* AI
- Transparent about what it is and how it works
- Teacher maintains oversight of all submitted work

### **"What about students without reliable internet?"**
- Chatbot works on any device with a browser
- Can be accessed at school computer labs
- Progress saves locally, so students can work in short sessions
- Checkpoints provide clear milestones (students don't need to use chatbot if they have other support)
- Instructor can provide alternative support for students who need it

### **"How much technical support will this require?"**
- Minimal! Chatbot is pre-built and fully functional
- Setup requires simple copy/paste into Canvas page
- No maintenance or updates needed during course
- Students interact with familiar chat interface
- Troubleshooting guide provided
