# Canvas Integration Instructions

## How to Embed the Changemaker Chatbot in Canvas

### Option 1: Embed in a Canvas Page (Recommended)

1. **Upload Files to Web Hosting**
   - Upload `index.html` and `chatbot.js` to a web hosting service (GitHub Pages, Replit, Netlify, etc.)
   - Note the URL where your `index.html` is hosted (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/changemaker-chatbot/`)

2. **Create a Canvas Page**
   - Go to your Canvas course
   - Click on "Pages" in the left navigation
   - Click "+ Page" to create a new page
   - Name it "Changemaker Plan Assistant" or similar

3. **Add the Iframe Embed Code**
   - Switch to HTML Editor mode (click "</>" icon in toolbar)
   - Paste the following code:

```html
<iframe src="YOUR_HOSTED_URL_HERE"
        width="100%"
        height="800"
        style="border: none; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
</iframe>

<p style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background-color: #e8f5e9; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; border-radius: 5px;">
  <strong>ðŸ’¡ About Your Changemaker Assistant:</strong><br>
  This chatbot will guide you through creating your changemaker plan over the 8-week course.
  Your progress is automatically saved in your browser, so you can come back anytime!
</p>
```

4. **Replace `YOUR_HOSTED_URL_HERE`** with your actual hosted URL

5. **Publish the Page**

### Option 2: Host on Canvas (Simple Method)

If you prefer not to use external hosting, you can use a simplified single-file version:

1. **Create a Canvas Page**
2. **Switch to HTML Editor**
3. **Copy the entire contents of the `canvas-embedded.html` file** (create this from combining index.html and chatbot.js)
4. **Paste and Publish**

Note: This method doesn't require external hosting but the page may load slightly slower.

### Option 3: As an External Tool (LTI)

For a more integrated experience, you can set up an LTI tool:
1. Host your chatbot on a server with HTTPS
2. Go to Course Settings â†’ Apps â†’ View App Configurations
3. Add a new External Tool
4. Enter your hosted URL

## Adding to Course Navigation

## Linking in Assignments

```

## Privacy & Data Storage

**Important Notes:**
- Student progress is saved locally in their browser using `localStorage`
- No data is sent to external servers
- Students must use the same browser/device to maintain progress
- If students clear their browser data, progress will be lost
- For backup, students can copy/paste their conversation or take screenshots
