## Development Process

### Phase 1: Initial Chatbot Creation
**Task:** Build core chatbot with HTML/CSS/JavaScript

**Files Created:**
- `index.html` - Main user interface with chat window, progress tracker
- `chatbot.js` - Core conversation logic with checkpoint system
- `styles.css` - Styling (later integrated into HTML)
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `FACULTY_PROPOSAL.md` - Pedagogical justification

**Features Implemented:**
- Rule-based conversation system
- 4-checkpoint progression tracking
- localStorage for progress persistence
- Responsive design with conservation theme
- Quick action buttons for student guidance

### Phase 2: GitHub Deployment
**Task:** Deploy chatbot to GitHub Pages

**Actions Taken:**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Changemaker chatbot with 4 checkpoints"
git remote add origin https://github.com/ndroger1/Conservation-chatbot.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Issue Encountered:**
- Merge conflict with existing README.md in repository
- **Solution:** Pulled with `--allow-unrelated-histories`, manually resolved conflict

---

## Issue #1: Send Button Not Working

### Problem
User reported: "The send button does not work once embedded"

### Diagnosis
Event bubbling issues in iframe context causing button clicks to not register properly.

### Solution
**Changes to chatbot.js:**
```javascript
// Added preventDefault and stopPropagation
sendBtn.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    this.handleUserMessage();
}, false);

// Added explicit button type
<button type="button" id="sendBtn">Send</button>

// Added button disable during processing
sendBtn.disabled = true;
// ... process message ...
sendBtn.disabled = false;
```

**Commit:**
```bash
git commit -m "Fix send button in embedded context"
git push origin main
```

---

## Issue #2: No AI Intelligence

### Problem
User reported: "The chat UI exists but there is not intelligence behind it"

### User Choice
Selected "free option" when offered AI integration choices:
1. Free (Hugging Face)
2. Paid (OpenAI/Claude)
3. No AI (rule-based only)

### Solution: Hybrid AI System

**Architecture Decision:**
- **Rule-based responses** for structured checkpoint questions
- **AI-powered responses** for open-ended questions/brainstorming
- Automatic detection of which mode to use

**Implementation:**

**Created `ai-config.js`:**
```javascript
class AIService {
    constructor() {
        this.apiEndpoint = 'https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2';
        this.apiKey = localStorage.getItem('huggingface_api_key');
    }

    async generateResponse(userMessage, conversationHistory, checkpoint) {
        // Call Hugging Face API with context
        // Return AI-generated response
    }

    getSystemPrompt() {
        // Age-appropriate, conservation-focused guidance
    }
}
```

**Modified `chatbot.js`:**
```javascript
async processUserInput(message) {
    const isStructuredQuestion = this.isStructuredCheckpointQuestion(message);

    if (isStructuredQuestion) {
        // Use rule-based response (fast, reliable)
        this.handleCheckpoint1(message);
    } else {
        // Use AI response (flexible, personalized)
        await this.handleWithAI(message);
    }
}
```

**Added AI Setup Modal:**
- "Setup AI" button in top right
- Step-by-step instructions for Hugging Face account
- API key input and validation
- Status indicator (red=inactive, green=active)

**Documentation Created:**
- `AI_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete student/teacher guide for AI setup
- Instructions for getting free Hugging Face API key
- Privacy and security information
- Troubleshooting guide

---

## Issue #3: JavaScript Syntax Error

### Problem
After pushing fixes, chatbot still not working. Console showed:
```
Unexpected identifier 'll'
```

### Diagnosis
Unescaped apostrophes in JavaScript strings on line 327-329 of `chatbot.js`:

**Broken Code:**
```javascript
1: 'In this checkpoint, you'll identify...'
//                        ^ This apostrophe ended string early
//                           ^ 'll' treated as unexpected code
```

### Root Cause
Single-quoted strings containing contractions like "you'll", "we'll" without proper escaping.

### Solution
**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
1: 'In this checkpoint, you\'ll identify what conservation issue you\'re passionate about...',
2: 'Now we\'ll do research and create your "Future Me" vision - imagining the positive impact you\'ll have made.',
3: 'Time to create your action plan! We\'ll break down the steps you\'ll take to make your vision a reality.',
```

**Commit:**
```bash
git add chatbot.js
git commit -m "Fix JavaScript syntax error - escape apostrophes in strings

Fixed unescaped apostrophes in you'll, we'll strings that were causing
'Unexpected identifier ll' syntax error"
git push origin main
```

**Deployment Wait:**
- GitHub Pages deployment: ~2-3 minutes
- Browser cache needed hard refresh to see changes
- Opened new browser tab to bypass cache entirely

**Result:** ✅ Chatbot now fully functional and responding to messages

## Problems Solved

### 1. Send Button Not Working in Iframe
**Issue:** Event bubbling in Canvas iframe context
**Solution:** Added preventDefault, stopPropagation, explicit button type
**Result:** ✅ Button works reliably in embedded context

### 2. No AI Intelligence
**Issue:** Chatbot only had static responses
**Solution:** Integrated Hugging Face API with hybrid rule/AI system
**Result:** ✅ Free, intelligent responses for open-ended questions

### 3. JavaScript Syntax Error
**Issue:** Unescaped apostrophes breaking script execution
**Solution:** Escaped all apostrophes in string literals
**Result:** ✅ Clean script execution, bot responds to messages

### 4. GitHub Merge Conflict
**Issue:** Repository had existing content
**Solution:** Pulled with --allow-unrelated-histories, manual resolution
**Result:** ✅ All files successfully deployed

### 5. Browser Caching
**Issue:** Updated code not loading after deployment
**Solution:** Hard refresh, opened new browser tab
**Result:** ✅ Latest version visible to users

• Climate action (renewable energy, reducing emissions)
• Ocean conservation (plastic pollution, coral reefs)
• Sustainable living (waste reduction, local food)
• Environmental education in your community

What gets you excited or concerned about our planet?
```

**Quick Actions Displayed:**

## Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
- **Device-Specific:** Progress doesn't sync across devices (localStorage limitation)
- **Browser-Specific:** Must use same browser to maintain progress
- **No Incognito Mode:** Private browsing won't save progress
- **Cold Start Delay:** AI first use takes 20-30 seconds (model loading)
- **Rate Limits:** Free AI tier has limits (mitigated by per-student keys)
- **Text-Only:** No file upload or voice interaction

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Cloud sync for cross-device progress
- Integration with Canvas gradebook
- Teacher dashboard for monitoring student progress
- Voice interaction support
- File attachment capability (for uploading drafts)
- Multi-language support
- Export conversation history feature

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Client-Side Only Architecture
**Rationale:**
- FERPA compliance (no student data on servers)
- Zero hosting costs
- Instant deployment
- No backend maintenance
- Privacy-first design

### 2. Hybrid AI System
**Rationale:**
- Reliable structured guidance (rule-based)
- Flexible open-ended responses (AI)
- Graceful degradation (works without AI)
- Best of both worlds

### 3. Free AI Provider (Hugging Face)
**Rationale:**
- No cost barrier for students
- Per-student keys = high rate limits
- Good model quality (Mistral-7B)
- Easy setup process
- Educational-friendly

### 4. localStorage for Persistence
**Rationale:**
- No server needed
- Instant save/load
- Privacy-preserving
- Browser-native API
- Sufficient for 8-week course

### 5. GitHub Pages Hosting
**Rationale:**
- Free hosting
- Automatic deployment from repo
- HTTPS included
- High reliability
- Version control integration
